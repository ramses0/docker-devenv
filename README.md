World's Cheapest VM
===================

Do you want a consistent development environment no matter what host you're on?

Look no further!

```
$ mkdir -p ~/Git/ && git clone '.../ramses0/rames-docker-devenv.git' ~/Git/profile
$ cd ~/Git/profile && ./build-env.sh && ./enter-env.sh
```

...anywhere you can run docker, you can run this "VM" which feels like a real unix system but effectively takes up no space anywhere.

It's made of internet and virtual machines!
